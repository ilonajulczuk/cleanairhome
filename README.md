## About This Starter Template

This starter template provides a React (based on Create React App) Chrome extension that renders into a content script. Due to this, it also utilizes messaging as you simply click the extension icon in the top right which will embed the extension via communication from the background script to the content script into the current page.

This template includes: React, Prettier, and Eslint.

## Manifest V3

This starter template uses the new Manifest V3 for Chrome Extensions. For more information, read the welcome guide here: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/

## Running The Extension

1. Run `npm install` in the folder to install dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server (auto refreshes your extension on change)
3. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your browser
4. Ensure `Developer mode` is `enabled` (top right)
5. Click `Load unpacked` in the top left
6. Select the `/build` folder in this directory

After completing the above steps, you should see the developer, unpacked version appear in your extension list as well as the extension icon appear in your browser bar alongside the other extensions you may have installed.

To trigger the extension, simply click the extension icon.

### All Available Commands

- `npm run build` - create a production ready build
- `npm run postbuild` - copies required Chrome extension files after build has completed
- `npm run assemble` - creates a production ready build and zips all files needed to publish in the web store to `extension.zip`
- `npm run dev` - creates a development server that can be used for hot reloading inside the Google Chrome extension ecosystem (see steps 1-6 above)
- `npm run test` - runs any Jest tests you may have
- `npm run pretty` - runs prettier on the `/src` folder
- `npm run lint` - runs eslint on the `/src` folder

## Making Changes

After starting the dev server via `npm run dev`, changes will be automatically be rebuilt to `/build` via webpack and the unpacked Chrome extension will automatically be refreshed for you behind the scenes, meaning you don't need to press the refresh button on `chrome://extensions`. Note: you may need to re-toggle or refresh the popup / page to see actual UI changes reflected there after a rebuild (i.e. re-open it again by clicking the icon again).

## Extending The Template

Extending this template would be similar to working on any other Create React App React application. The core of the React app lives in the `/src` and is unopinionated in terms of how it's been setup, so have fun!

### Images and Other Media

Although you'd largely work on this starter like any other React app, images and other media work slightly different for this starter. Since the React app is injected into the current page via the content scripts, you can't just import images as you normally would in a React app. Doing it this way would result in the URL of the image source taking in the current pages URL. Instead, there is a `/assets` folder where you should add all your images and other assets. After that, you need to reference it via the `chrome.runtime` API. Everything in the `/assets` folder will get copied over to `/static/assets` in the build.

For example, in this extension there is one image, `graphic.png`. It has been inserted into the `/assets` folder and can be referenced via ``.

## Manifest Explained

There are 4 key sections of the manifest with this example template:

### Browser Action

```
  "action": {
    "default_icon": {
      "32": "icon.png"
    },
    "default_title": "Open Extension"
  },
```

This portion of the manifest is used to define how the browser action (extension icon) should behave. In this case, we don't define anything other than the icon and the title, as the clicking action will be handled by the background script in `background.js`.

### Background Scripts

```
"background": {
  "service_worker": "background.js"
},
```

This portion of the manifest tells the browser that we want to run some scripts in the background while this extension is enabled. In the case of this example template, the background script is there to listen for clicks on the extension icon and then sends a message via the `chrome.tabs` API (content scripts will listen for it). The background script lives outside of the `/src` folder as it shouldn't contain any React code.

### Content Scripts

```
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["http://*/*", "https://*/*"],
      "js": [
        "/static/js/0.chunk.js",
        "/static/js/main.chunk.js",
        "/static/js/runtime-main.js"
      ],
      "run_at": "document_end"
    }
  ],
```

This portion of the manifest defines all the content scripts the extension will use. In this case, the content scripts are the static assets generated by building the React app. We also define that we want them to run at document end on every page (`["http://*/*", "https://*/*"]`).

### Web Accessible Resources

```
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    {
      "resources": ["/static/assets/*"],
      "matches": ["http://*/*", "https://*/*"]
    }
  ]
```

## Preparing to Publish

To prepare for publish, simply run `npm run assemble` which will kick off a production-ready build step and then zip all the contents to `extension.zip` in the folder root. This zip file will include all the files you need for your extension to be uploaded to the web store.

Note: if this isn't your first publish of your extension, make sure you bump up the verison number in the manifest (for example, `1.0.0` to `1.0.1`), as the web store will require a new version in every update you upload.

## Using TypeScript

TypeScript can easily be configured to work with this template as it's based on `create-react-app`. To get started, first run:

```
npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
```

Afterwards, create a `tsconfig.json` in the folder root with your desired settings. If you want, you can use the CRA default:

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "lib": [
      "dom",
      "dom.iterable",
      "esnext"
    ],
    "allowJs": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "strict": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "jsx": "react"
  },
  "include": [
    "src"
  ]
}
```

Next, create a `react-app-env.d.ts` file in the `/src` folder with the following content:

```
/// <reference types="react-scripts" />
```

Finally, rename files to `.tsx` or `.ts` in the `/src` folder and you're ready to go!
